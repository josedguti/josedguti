## A little bit about me...ðŸ¤”

I am a Software Engineer with a background in customer service and IT Support.I am a goal-oriented individual seeking opportunities to continue to learn and contribute to a team in the Software Development industry. I have experience with front-end development like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, MERN Stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js), and also experience programming with back-end technologies such as Ruby on Rails and Python/Django.
